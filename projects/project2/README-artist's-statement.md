Artist's Statement

Longing is a program about the hardships of unreciprocated love, it tells a story about a woman reading letters from her former partner as she tries to jump through obstacles to get to her. It is a story about longing for someone but finally realizing that you deserve better and there is no need to chase if it is the right person. This story is told by having each level symbolize the hardships that are faced when put in a relationship that is carried by one person, with each note putting these hardships into words. I want the user experience to be one where the user can roam around to try and see how they can get the notes. I do not want to add too many directions because it is a program about learning from mistakes in itself. I feel like I accomplished all the levels the way I wanted them to be, and everything feels understandable enough for any user to play it swiftly. For the technical aspect, the complexity of the game comes from all the different movements of each character. For example the different player controls, the other objects that chase or run away, and the moving arrays that block the path. It is not very complex code but for a beginner, I feel satisfied with what I was able to produce with the help of my professor and TA. Artistically, I enjoyed changing the shapes and colours to give things more meaning, such as the change in flower colour to bring a sense of giving up. As well as the similar coloured strangers to the food which made the food more hidden. I wanted to make my program with all the code I understand even if that makes it simple. To me, all those shapes and colours create a real story.
